Hi, I'm Stephanie!

I’m a Biomedical Engineer pursuing a PhD in Microbiology & Immunology at the University of Michigan. I study transmission and within-host evolution of methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) through a combination of genomics and epidemiology in [Dr. Evan Snitkin's lab](http://thesnitkinlab.com/) using R. 

I also enjoy teaching others how to code through [Girls Who Code](http://umich.edu/~girlswc/) and [Software Carpentry](https://umswc.github.io/). 

You’ll find me outside of lab hanging out with my beloved cats, searching for fun exercise classes, listening to science and comedy podcasts, or attending a concert.
